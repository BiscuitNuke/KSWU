I recently picked up a 2005 Subaru Baja — one of the most versatile vehicles Subaru ever made. The Baja was produced from 2003 to 2006 and was essentially a cross between a Legacy/Outback and a small pickup. Overall, being a Subaru owner, it was a car that i've always wanted to work on. 

Even though it never sold in big numbers, the Baja has built a pretty large following thanks to its unique design, AWD system, and Subaru reliability. My particular model is the turbo/stickshift version, which makes it even more fun to drive and mod.

### My Build Goals
I’m converting this Baja into a **wardriving and overlanding rig**, so we're going to do a few fun things. That means:  
- Setting up servers and networking gear in the bed for wardriving and experimentation. We might be talking about offgrid battery backups as well for redundancy and on-the-road testing.  
- Mounting antennas and radios for wireless exploration. This could possibly include a Starlink connection for roaming wireless connection that doesn't depend on cell providers.
- Equipping it with overlanding gear like roof racks, recovery boards, and storage solutions for long trips. Even though it already has some modifications from the old owner, I was thinking about adding more "useful" features/compartments (Such as packout).

### Why the Baja?
The Baja strikes the perfect balance: it’s rugged enough for trails and camping, but compact and practical enough for daily driving. Plus, there’s something cool about taking a forgotten piece of Subaru history and giving it new life as a one-of-a-kind tech/adventure build.  

This project will evolve as I go — but first I've been having to replace the control arms and CV axles as the rust up here can really degrade older parts.
