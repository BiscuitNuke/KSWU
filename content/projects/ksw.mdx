Hello, I’m Kieran Wittstruck.
I’m a cybersecurity student at the Rochester Institute of Technology with a passion for building and securing systems. Since middle school I’ve been developing for the web, and over time I’ve expanded into backend engineering, system administration, and network security.

Professionally, I’ve worked as a Web Developer and Photographer at Vital Air Services, where I managed online presence, built customer-facing tools, and produced media to strengthen brand identity. I also contributed as a cybersecurity volunteer for Fulton County School Systems when I was in high school.

Outside of class and work, I run an extensive homelab environment where I experiment with virtualization, Kubernetes clusters, networking, and storage solutions. It’s both a playground for testing ideas and a training ground for real-world security concepts.

This site brings together my projects, professional experience, and creative work. I am currently working on https://malwaremart.com for my cybersecurity and other project work!
